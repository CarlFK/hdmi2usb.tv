# Welcome!

Welcome to TimVideos!  We're busy working on several exciting video-related Open Source projects right now.  Whether you want to work hands-on with hardware or code in a variety of languages, we have a project for you.  Join the team! 

This information should help you explore the projects and learn how to get started.

## Getting Started

Google Summer of Code (or similar project based program) students should first head over to the [Summer of Code](wiki/Summer-Of-Code) page and then head to our [Ideas Page](wiki/Ideas-Page).

If you are just interested in contributing and this is your first visit, head over to the [Ideas Page](wiki/Ideas-Page).

If you have a Digilent Atlys Board, head over to the [HDMI2USB Wiki](https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB/wiki) and specifically look at the [Getting started with Atlys Board](https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB/wiki/Getting-Started-with-an-Atlys-Board) page.
