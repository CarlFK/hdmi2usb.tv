Welcome to the "getting started with Tim Videos" documentation project! 

As Tim Video's is a conglomeration of a bunch of Open Source projects it can be quite hard to find you way around. This information should help you figure out where you need to go and what you need to do to get started!

## Getting Started

Google Summer of Code students should first head over to the [Summer of Code](wiki/Summer-Of-Code) page and then head to our [general ideas page](wiki/Ideas-Page).

If you are just interested in contributing and this is your first visit, head over to the [general ideas page](wiki/Ideas-Page).

If you have brought/received a Digilent Atlys Board, head over to the [HDMI2USB Wiki](https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB/wiki) and specifically look at the [Getting started with Atlys Board](https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB/wiki/Getting-Started-with-an-Atlys-Board) page.
