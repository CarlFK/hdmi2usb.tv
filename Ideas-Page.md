HDMI2USB is the core hardware project in the Tim Video's suite. It's job is to capture the display output of a laptop and bring it back onto a different computer.

**All hardware projects will require you to have a Digilent ATLYS prototype board.** [See Prototyping Board for more information](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/wiki/Ideas-Page#prototyping-board).

### Prototyping Board
For developing features for the HDMI2USB system we use a [Digilent ATLYS prototype board](http://digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,400,836&Prod=ATLYS).  

If you can show that you are committed to developing hardware (such as starting through a program like Google Summer of Code). You can apply for a grant to have a board send to you

### Key Features
It doesn't require any modification of the system being captured and is ideal for capturing conference slides from wide variety of sources.
