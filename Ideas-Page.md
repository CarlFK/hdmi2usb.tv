# Overview

Tim Video's is actually a number of *different* but related projects. There are a huge variety of ways to get started in a huge variety of different areas.

To help you decide where you interest might like, we have created the following flow diagram:

# Hardware Projects

HDMI2USB is the core hardware project in the Tim Video's suite. It's job is to capture the display output of a laptop and bring it back onto a different computer.

**All hardware projects will require you to have a Digilent ATLYS prototype board.** [See Prototyping Board for more information](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/wiki/Ideas-Page#prototyping-board).

### Prototyping Board
For developing features for the HDMI2USB system we use a [Digilent ATLYS prototype board](http://digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,400,836&Prod=ATLYS).  

> The Atlys circuit board is a complete, ready-to-use digital circuit development platform
> based on a Xilinx Spartan 6 LX45 FPGA. The on-board collection of high-end peripherals,
> including Gbit Ethernet, HDMI Video, 128Mbyte DDR2 memory array, audio and USB ports make
> the Atlys board an ideal host for complete digital systems built around embedded
> processors like Xilinxâ€™s MicroBlaze. Atlys is fully compatible with all Xilinx CAD tools,
> including ChipScope, EDK, and the free WebPack, so designs can be completed with no extra
> costs. 


If you can show that you are committed to developing hardware (such as starting through a program like Google Summer of Code). You can apply for a grant to have a board send to you

### Key Features
It doesn't require any modification of the system being captured and is ideal for capturing conference slides from wide variety of sources.
