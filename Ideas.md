# Overview

Tim Video's is actually a number of *different* but related projects. There are a huge variety of ways to get started in a huge variety of different areas.

To help you decide which project you might like, we have created the following flow diagram:

---------------------------------------

# Software Projects

## gst-switch

This project is intended to be a replacement of DV-switch based on GStreamer.

## flumotion

flumotion is a project that is older than the Tim Video's suite. Originally developed by Fluendo, it uses the gstreamer platform to do the actual heavy lifting.

## TimVideos

Repository for actually deploying a live streaming system, includes website, set up scripts and watchdog code.

# Hardware Projects

## HDMI2USB

HDMI2USB is a core hardware project in the Tim Video's suite. 

There are two types of projects to work on with the HDMI2USB system;
 * Firmware Projects - As the device uses a Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA, developing much of the hardware is actually a process of developing software! [More information on HDMI2USB firmware]().
 * Extension Boards - The Digilent ATLYS only has limited I/O, extension boards are PCBs which connect to the Digilent ATLYS's [VHDCI connector](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-high-density_cable_interconnect) and extend the functionality. [More information on HDMI2USB extension boards]()

**All hardware projects will require you to have a [Digilent ATLYS prototype board](http://digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,400,836&Prod=ATLYS).**

### HDMI2USB Extension Boards
For developing features for the HDMI2USB system we use a [Digilent ATLYS prototype board](http://digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,400,836&Prod=ATLYS).

> The Atlys circuit board is a complete, ready-to-use digital circuit development platform
> based on a Xilinx Spartan 6 LX45 FPGA. The on-board collection of high-end peripherals,
> including Gbit Ethernet, HDMI Video, 128Mbyte DDR2 memory array, audio and USB ports make
> the Atlys board an ideal host for complete digital systems built around embedded
> processors like Xilinxâ€™s MicroBlaze. Atlys is fully compatible with all Xilinx CAD tools,
> including ChipScope, EDK, and the free WebPack, so designs can be completed with no extra
> costs.

If you can show that you are committed to developing hardware (such as being accepted into a program like Google Summer of Code), **you can apply for a grant to have a board provided to you for development.**
