# Overview

Tim Video's is actually a number of *different* but related projects. There are a huge variety of ways to get started in a huge variety of different areas.

To help you decide which project you might like, we have created the following flow diagram:

# Software Projects

## gst-switch
([Code](http://github.com/timvideos/gst-switch)) | ([Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/group/gst-switch)) | ([IRC Channel](irc://irc.freenode.org/#gst-switch))

This project is intended to be a replacement of [DVswitch](http://dvswitch.alioth.debian.org/wiki/) based on [GStreamer](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/).

> DVswitch is a digital video mixer intended for interactive live mixing of
> several incoming DV video streams. It was originally designed for the needs
> of DebConf; It has now been used for various other conferences, meetings and
> live musical performances.


 * gst-switch is written in C

## flumotion
([Code](https://code.flumotion.com/cgit/)) | ([Mailing Lists](http://lists.fluendo.com/mailman/listinfo)) | ([IRC Channel](irc://irc.freenode.org/#fluendo))

While flumotion was **not** originally developed for TimVideos.us, it is used
heavily to do the live video streaming side. For this reason we will have
numerous ideas on how to improve the platform for our usecase.

> Flumotion is an award winning streaming software created in 2006 by a group
> of open source developers and multimedia experts. Flumotion Streaming
> Software allows broadcasters and companies to stream content live and on
> demand in all the leading formats from a single server.


## Streaming System
([Code](http://github.com/timvideos/streaming-system)) | ([IRC Channel](irc://irc.freenode.org/#timvideos))

Repository for actually deploying a live streaming system consisting of a flumotion setup and website.

 * The streaming system including a django based website, shell script set up scripts and Python watchdog code.

# Hardware Projects

## HDMI2USB

HDMI2USB is a core hardware project in the Tim Video's suite. There are two types of projects to work on with the HDMI2USB system;
 * Firmware Projects - As the device uses a Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA, developing much of the hardware is actually a process of developing software!<br>[More information on current HDMI2USB firmware](https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB/wiki/Firmware).
 * Extension Boards - The Digilent ATLYS can be extended via the [VHDCI connector](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-high-density_cable_interconnect).<br>[More information on existing HDMI2USB extension boards]()

 * [Code](http://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB.git)
 * [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/group/hdmi2usb?hl=en-GB)
 * [IRC Channel](irc://irc.freenode.org/#hdmi2usb) - Freenode IRC, channel #hdmi2usb. [IRC Logs]()

<p style='font-size: 18px; color: red; text-align: center;'>
<strong>!!! All hardware projects will require you to have a Digilent ATLYS prototype board !!!</strong>
</p>

### Digilent ATLYS Prototype Board

For developing features for the HDMI2USB system we use a [Digilent ATLYS prototype board](http://digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,400,836&Prod=ATLYS).

> The Atlys circuit board is a complete, ready-to-use digital circuit development platform
> based on a Xilinx Spartan 6 LX45 FPGA. The on-board collection of high-end peripherals,
> including Gbit Ethernet, HDMI Video, 128Mbyte DDR2 memory array, audio and USB ports make
> the Atlys board an ideal host for complete digital systems built around embedded
> processors like Xilinxâ€™s MicroBlaze. Atlys is fully compatible with all Xilinx CAD tools,
> including ChipScope, EDK, and the free WebPack, so designs can be completed with no extra
> costs.

If you can show that you are committed to developing hardware (such as being accepted into a program like Google Summer of Code), **you can apply for a grant to have a board provided to you for development.**
