# Overview

Tim Video's is actually a number of **different** but related projects. There are a huge variety of ways to get started in a huge variety of different areas.

To help you decide which **existing** projects you might like to help out with, we have created the following flow diagram:

# Software Projects

**The following software projects have tasks that you can work on.**

## gst-switch
[(Code)](http://github.com/timvideos/gst-switch) | [(Mailing List)](https://groups.google.com/group/gst-switch) | [(IRC Channel)](irc://irc.freenode.org/#gst-switch) | [(Bug Tracker)](http://github.com/timvideos/gst-switch/issues)

 * [Tasks in the gst-switch project](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues?labels=gst-switch).

gst-switch project is intended to be a replacement of [DVswitch](http://dvswitch.alioth.debian.org/wiki/) based on [GStreamer](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/). It aims to do interactive live mixing of incoming video streams, designed for the needs of conference recording.

> DVswitch is a digital video mixer intended for interactive live mixing of
> several incoming DV video streams. It was originally designed for the needs
> of DebConf; It has now been used for various other conferences, meetings and
> live musical performances.

#### gst-switch is written in C and uses GStreamer

## speakertrack
*Use the gst-switch, code repository, mailing lists and IRC channel.*

speakertrack is a bunch of extensions to gstreamer and gst-switch to allow automatic tracking of speakers using PTZ cameras rather then needing a camera operator. 

#### speakertrack is written in C and uses OpenCV


## Streaming System
[(Code)](http://github.com/timvideos/streaming-system) | [(IRC Channel)](irc://irc.freenode.org/#timvideos) | [(Bug Tracker)](http://github.com/timvideos/streaming-system/issues)

 * [Tasks in the **Streaming System Website** project](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues?labels=website)

Repository for actually deploying a live streaming system consisting of a flumotion setup and website.

#### The streaming system including a django based website, shell script set up scripts and Python watchdog code.

# Hardware Projects

**The following hardware projects have tasks that you can work on.**

## HDMI2USB
[(Code)](http://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB.git) | [(Mailing List)](https://groups.google.com/group/hdmi2usb?hl=en-GB) | [(IRC Channel)](irc://irc.freenode.org/#hdmi2usb) | [(Bug Tracker)](http://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB/issues)


HDMI2USB is a core hardware project in the Tim Video's suite. There are two types of projects to work on with the HDMI2USB system;
 * Firmware Projects - As the device uses a Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA, developing much of the hardware is actually a process of developing software!<br>[More information on current HDMI2USB firmware](https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB/wiki/Firmware).
 * Extension Boards - The Digilent ATLYS can be extended via the [VHDCI connector](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-high-density_cable_interconnect).<br>[More information on existing HDMI2USB extension boards]()


<p style='font-size: 18px; color: red; text-align: center;'>
<strong>!!! All hardware projects will require you to have a Digilent ATLYS prototype board !!!</strong>
</p>

### Digilent ATLYS Prototype Board

For developing features for the HDMI2USB system we use a [Digilent ATLYS prototype board](http://digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,400,836&Prod=ATLYS).

> The Atlys circuit board is a complete, ready-to-use digital circuit development platform
> based on a Xilinx Spartan 6 LX45 FPGA. The on-board collection of high-end peripherals,
> including Gbit Ethernet, HDMI Video, 128Mbyte DDR2 memory array, audio and USB ports make
> the Atlys board an ideal host for complete digital systems built around embedded
> processors like Xilinxâ€™s MicroBlaze. Atlys is fully compatible with all Xilinx CAD tools,
> including ChipScope, EDK, and the free WebPack, so designs can be completed with no extra
> costs.

If you can show that you are committed to developing hardware (such as being accepted into a program like Google Summer of Code), **you can apply for a grant to have a board provided to you for development.**

# Partner Projects

## flumotion
[(Code)](https://code.flumotion.com/cgit/) | [(Mailing Lists)](http://lists.fluendo.com/mailman/listinfo) | [(IRC Channel)](irc://irc.freenode.org/#fluendo)

 * [**flumotion** Tasks](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues?labels=flumotion)

While flumotion was **not** originally developed for TimVideos.us, it is used
heavily to do the live video streaming side. For this reason we will have
numerous ideas on how to improve the platform for our usecase.

> Flumotion is an award winning streaming software created in 2006 by a group
> of open source developers and multimedia experts. Flumotion Streaming
> Software allows broadcasters and companies to stream content live and on
> demand in all the leading formats from a single server.

#### flumotion is written in Python and uses GStreamer

## gstreamer

[(Code)](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer) | [(Mailing Lists)](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/lists/) | [(IRC Channel)](irc://irc.freenode.org/#gstreamer) 

 * [**gstreamer** Tasks](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues?labels=gstreamer)

While gstreamer was **not** originally developed for TimVideos.us, it is used
heavily by gst-switch for doing video mixing and heavily by flumotion to do the
heavy lifting of media processing. For this reason we will have numerous ideas
on how to improve the platform for our usecase.



> GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components.
> The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback,
> audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear
> editing) processing. Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and
> filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by
> writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface.

#### gstreamer is written in C
