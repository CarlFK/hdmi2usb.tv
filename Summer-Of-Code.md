The following links detail successful general ways to write a Summer of Code Proposal:

Please read [http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/program/google/gsoc2009/faqs](Google's Summer of Code Student FAQ) and advice from past participants as you create your proposal. **Feel free to submit multiple proposals.**

Mithro has prepared some [http://forums.thousandparsec.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=101](tips for writing an application). **PLEASE** read this before submitting an application.

Feel free to write your proposal on the wiki. Please link it from the [[Google](Summer of Code/Proposals2010|Proposals2010)] page.

## Selection Criteria

The following gives some indication of some of the things we are looking for. There will probably be some subjective elements to it, but it's hoped that by trying to quantify the decision process, it'll help people understand why their application was or was not accepted.

 * **Proposal is longer than a few sentences.** We need some meat in the proposal in order to even consider it.
 * **Proposer has contacted us prior to the submission.** This demonstrates a definite interest in Thousand Parsec and proves an ability to communicate with us.
 * **Proposer knows the appropriate programming language(s).**
 * **Proposer shows evidence of being able to create software.** Our goal is to help programmers become good at Open Source, not to teach non-programmers how to program. However, we are willing to help people develop their programming skills.
 * **Proposal is well written.** While we don't expect perfect English, we do expect that the proposer took time to spell check, proofread it, organize it logically, and use comprehendable grammar.
 *  **Proposal demonstrates understanding of subject matter.** We expect the proposer to do some research, ask questions, and gain some understanding of the project they're proposing. This gives us confidence that they'll be able to complete the project successfully.
 * **Proposal shows creativity.** We like to see someone thinking outside the box, including proposing ideas for projects we hadn't listed.
 * **Proposal is the only submission for the given task.** Many proposals focus on the same few tasks, so if you're the only person proposing to do a given project, that weighs in your favor.
 * **Proposal shows implementation planning.** If the author has broken the work out into a task list, it shows that they know what they'll be doing.
 * **Proposal scope is realistic.** 3 months goes fast. Proposals that are promising too much are unlikely to be completed in a timely fashion.
 * **Proposal shows motivation.** While it's important to describe the project in detail and show us that you have the necessary skills, do not forget to communicate your motivation, i.e. why you want to work for us on this particular project.

The following are conditions that result in automatic rejection:
 * Reject: Group project proposed. Google has specified that groups MAY NOT participate. Individuals only.
 * Reject: Proposer is not a student. Requirement of the program.


# Questions

 * Read up the [http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/dev/index.php developer section].
 * Join the mailing lists for the project you are interested in.
 * Join the IRC chat channel [#timvideos on irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.org/#timvideos).

# Ideas

You can find our ideas list at [[Ideas for Programmers]] page. The list is not definitive and any student is more than **welcome to come up with their own idea** to work on. **Initiative is a skill which will rate highly** when selecting projects. Feel free to come up with your own projects.

# Thanks

We would like to thank the following people,

* http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Summer_of_Code Creative Commons - a lot of the information in this document was adapted from their Summer of Code page.
* [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.com/) - the Inkscape project also has a large amount of stuff which was useful in creating this page.
* [Google](http://www.google.com/) - without Google this wouldn't even be possible.



# Tips


I have been looking over the proposals and there are a couple of things that many seem to be lacking. I have put this email together to help you fix these and help make your proposals better.

## Tip 1 - Include IRC Nickname

Include your IRC nick as the first thing in the detailed description. 

In the last month there have been over 50 new people turn up, keeping you all straight is hard for us. Specially when your IRC nick, email address and real name have no resemblance.

## Tip 2 - Project First, Resume Second

We are most interested in your proposal for the project. If your proposal looks good we may then look at your resume / personal description.

Hence, include the project information first and your personal stuff second.


## Tip 3 - Include assertive Functional Milestones

One of the best ways to show that you are a serious students is to include proper assertive milestones. These should be a single sentences which say something like 
The AI will issue move orders.
The client will be able to display planets in a 3d fashion.
The ruleset will allow tpclient-pywx to see planets.
The metaserver will display a starmap generated from starmapper.

The keyword here is will, it is assertive.

These milestones should have dates associated with them. We understand that you are new to the project and that these dates will change as the project progresses. You *will not* fail just because a milestone had to be moved a week or dropped all together.

The milestones should be testable and specific. Here are some examples which are not acceptable.
The AI framework will be finish.
The star map will work.
The ruleset will be balanced.

Negative milestones are hard to test, avoid them if possible. For example "The AI will not issue wrong orders" is almost impossible to prove and not all that useful. More often negative statements are goals not milestones.

These milestones will be hard to figure out, being able to talk about specifics shows that you are well researched and know your stuff. Have
confidence in your own abilities!

Keep your milestones small, they should be doable in less then a weeks full time work. The smaller (and more specific) they are, the harder it will be to get behind.

Talk to the mentors about your milestones, they have huge amount of knowledge about what is realistic and can really help you refine the details.

## Tip 4 - We are not mind readers

?Anything which is not linked to from your proposal effectively does not exist. I'm afraid we can not (yet) read your mind. 

I personally have a crap memory, it is unlikely that I will remember that IRC conversation we had about XYZ. Other mentors may not have seen that conversation either.

If you have thought about a certain way to do something tell us, even if you decided that it was not feasible. If you had an important IRC conversation which resulted in changing the way you think, link too the logs. If a web page was influential tell us about it!

## Tip 5 - Submit now!

Do not leave it to the last minute as you won't have time to update the proposal based on feedback. There is still plenty of time for mentors to give feedback and you to update your proposal.

Last year all accepted student for Thousand Parsec went through at least three updates to their applications.

## Tip 6 - Make your application public

Having a public application means not only can mentors give you feedback but other students and the general community can too!

Using a wiki is a good idea because it lets us look at the history of how your proposal has evolved. It also means you can have formatting making it easier to read.

## Tip 7 - Splitting applications which are too big

Google limits the text you can submit for your detailed description to XXX characters. This can be quite limited if you have some detailed information or pseudo code. 

It is recommended that you produce two versions of your application.

A "cut back" version which fits into the character limit. This should be all the very important bits of your application. You must include your functional milestones in this section. There should be enough meat in this section to convince us to look at your further URL.

The URL in the document should link to your full proposal. Feel free to add things like pseudo code, ruleset design information or anything else which you feel is relevant.

This linked proposal you should also include your complete Google application. The text which is being duplicated should be clearly marked in a different colour but still readable. Assume that clicking the link replace the Google application with the page and we can no longer remember the original proposal.

Remember quality is better then quantity!
