Please read [http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/program/google/gsoc2009/faqs Google's Summer of Code Student FAQ] and advice from past participants as you create your proposal. '''Feel free to submit multiple proposals.'''

Mithro has prepared some [http://forums.thousandparsec.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=101 tips for writing an application]. '''PLEASE''' read this before submitting an application.

Feel free to write your proposal on the wiki. Please link it from the [[Google Summer of Code/Proposals2010|Proposals2010]] page.

The following gives some indication of some of the things we are looking for. There will probably be some subjective elements to it, but it's hoped that by trying to quantify the decision process, it'll help people understand why their application was or was not accepted.

* '''Proposal is longer than a few sentences.''' We need some meat in the proposal in order to even consider it.
* '''Proposer has contacted us prior to the submission.''' This demonstrates a definite interest in Thousand Parsec and proves an ability to communicate with us.
* '''Proposer knows the appropriate programming language(s).'''
* '''Proposer shows evidence of being able to create software.''' Our goal is to help programmers become good at Open Source, not to teach non-programmers how to program. However, we are willing to help people develop their programming skills.
* '''Proposal is well written.''' While we don't expect perfect English, we do expect that the proposer took time to spell check, proofread it, organize it logically, and use comprehendable grammar.
* '''Proposal demonstrates understanding of subject matter.''' We expect the proposer to do some research, ask questions, and gain some understanding of the project they're proposing. This gives us confidence that they'll be able to complete the project successfully.
* '''Proposal shows creativity.''' We like to see someone thinking outside the box, including proposing ideas for projects we hadn't listed.
* '''Proposal is the only submission for the given task.''' Many proposals focus on the same few tasks, so if you're the only person proposing to do a given project, that weighs in your favor.
* '''Proposal shows implementation planning.''' If the author has broken the work out into a task list, it shows that they know what they'll be doing.
* '''Proposal scope is realistic.''' 3 months goes fast. Proposals that are promising too much are unlikely to be completed in a timely fashion.
* '''Proposal shows motivation.''' While it's important to describe the project in detail and show us that you have the necessary skills, do not forget to communicate your motivation, i.e. why you want to work for us on this particular project.

The following are conditions that result in automatic rejection:

* Reject: Group project proposed. Google has specified that groups MAY NOT participate. Individuals only.
* Reject: Proposer is not a student. Requirement of the program.
