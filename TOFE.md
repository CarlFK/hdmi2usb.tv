# TOFE - Tim's Open FPGA Expansion

The TOFE interface dramatically reduces the cost of high-speed I/O
functionality by taking inspiration from the PCI-Express standard and
re-purposing its connectors and mechanical specifications.

TimVideos and Numato are committed to developing expansion boards to add new
features (such as VGA capture) to the Opsis board through the TOFE connector.
We also plan to create simple adapter boards to other existing expansion I/O
standards such as PMOD and the Digilent VHDCI.

We hope that the significantly reduced cost of the TOFE interface will also
enable the community to create new expansion boards we havenâ€™t even dreamt of
yet!

## Why?

We want a FPGA expansion that fits the following criteria;

 * Open standard that anyone can access without NDA or other agreements.
 * Cheap connection interface that are easily accessible to **any** hobbyists.
 * Supports high speed signals >5 Gbit/s.

## Specification

### Naming

#### Motherboard Connectors

The aim with naming of a TOFE motherboard connector completely describes the
features available.

The name scheme needs to include;

 * PCI Express connector size
   * 1x
   * 4x
   * 8x
   * 16x

 * The number of lanes populated. To improve brevity, if the number of lanes
   populated is left out then **all** lanes in the connector should be
   populated.

 * If the connector supports "bi-directional" or "uni-directional" signaling.
   * B - Bi-Directional
   * S - Uni-directional

 * The maximum operating lane speed;
   * 1500M
   * 3125M
   * XXXXM

 * The minimum operating lane speed. If unspecified, then it is assume the lane
   can operate down to DC.

 * The compatible IO standards that are supported.
   * Voltage levels which are compatible.
     * 1.5V, 1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V.

   * Signalling standards.
     * LVDS - Low Voltage Differential Signaling
     * RSDS - Reduced Swing Differential Signaling
     * PPDS - Point-to-Point Differential Signaling
     * TMDS - Transition Minimized Differential Signaling
     * BLVDS - Bus LVDS

   * Line encodings which are compatible.
     * 8b/10b - Used by pretty much everything.
     * 64b/66b - 10 Gbit/s Ethernet
     * 64b/67b - Interlaken
     * 128b/130b - PCI-Express Gen 3 and higher.
     * 128b/132b - USB3.1

 * The amount of power that can be provided,
   * All together (from both 3.3V and 12V combined).
   * Just via the 12V pins.
   * Just via the 3.3V pins.

 * Any extra properties that could be useful like;
   * Beacon signaling for PCI Express compatibility.
   * SATA Out-of-Band signaling.


#### Daughterboard

The aim with naming a TOFE daughter board is to completely describe the
features required for the daughter board to correctly operate.

##### PCI-Express

PCI-Express cards are actually compatible with TOFE motherboard sockets which
meet the following requirements;

| Version | Generation | Lane Speed  | Line code |
| 1.0     | Gen 1      |  2.5 Gbit/s | 8b/10b    |
| 2.0     | Gen 2      |  5.0 Gbit/s | 8b/10b    | 
| 3.0     | Gen 3      |  8.0 Gbit/s | 128b/130b |
| 4.0     | Gen 4      | 16.0 Gbit/s | 128b/130b | 


PCI-Express 1st gen would be
  TOFE-Xx-3000M-PS

### Mechanical

TOFE boards should be mechanically identical to PCI-Express **half length**
cards in either **full height** or **half height** (also called low profile).

However, the only regions which matter for TOFE boards are the PCI-Express
fingers and the mechanical drill holes. See the following diagram;

![TOFE Requirements Diagram](/img/tofe/tofe-layout-full-height.png)

Any of the area marked in green is free to be changed. This offers a wide range
of mechanical designs, such as shown in this diagram;
