For GSoC the most important factor is the application quality! If the strongest application is for a lower priority project it is much more likely to be accepted even if poorer applications exist for higher priority projects.

### What should I do next?

Start writing your proposal as shown in the [Writing Proposals](#writing-proposals) section. This will help you ask better questions too!
