Google Summer of Code will require you to work independently and hence showing independent investigation and troubleshooting skills **is a must**. We definitely encourage asking questions of the mentors but you must demonstate researching the question. 

The following is **bad** example. It demonstrates no research or thinking. The response to this question will be a link to this page!

> Hi

> I'd like to work on "[HDMI2USB #14] Supporting Marvell Ethernet chip on Digilent board" project, please guide me.

The following is a **good** example. It demonstrates research and thinking about the issue and more in depth questioning.

> Hi
> 
> I'm currently researching the "[HDMI2USB #14] Supporting Marvell Ethernet chip on Digilent board" issue and have a number of questions I'd like clarified.
> 
> The Marvell Ethernet chip appears to be a RGMII compatible PHYs interface. I have found a number of compatible cores at OpenCores and want to know if reusing their work is acceptable? I also found that a person has had some success at http://www.joelw.id.au/FPGA/DigilentAtlysResources and would like to follow their approach.
> 
> What level of network protocols need to be supported? Using a low level Ethernet frame would be significantly easier from the FPGA side but would require more work on the connected PC. Using UDP seems like the best compromise between difficulty and compatibility. TCP/IP would had a huge amount more complexity and I'm not sure of the added benefit. Would it be okay to just support UDP?

Some good pages to look for tips about writing good questions can be found below;

Often the best way to ask questions is to start writing your Google Summer of Code proposal as documented in the [Writing Proposals](#writing-proposals) section and find out what areas you are getting stuck at.
