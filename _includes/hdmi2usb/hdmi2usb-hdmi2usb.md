HDMI2USB is hardware for capturing [HDMI][HDMI], [DVI][DVI] and [DisplayPort][DisplayPort] data. By capturing in high quality what is being presented locally it facilitates sharing with remote users and creates great recordings for later viewing.

The HDMI2USB hardware can also capture the [HDMI][HDMI] output from cameras.
