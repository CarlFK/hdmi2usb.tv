**Welcome to TimVideos.us!**

**TimVideos.us** is a group of exciting projects which together create a system for doing both _recording and live event streaming_ for **conferences**, **meetings**, **user groups** and **other** presentations. 

We hope that, through our _projects_, the costs and expertise currently required to produce live streaming events will be reduced to near zero. We wish to develop a system where everyone has the ability to record presentations and host live remote participants across the globe.

Whether you want to work hands-on with hardware or code in a variety of languages, we have a project for you. Join the team! This information should help you explore the projects and learn how to get started.
