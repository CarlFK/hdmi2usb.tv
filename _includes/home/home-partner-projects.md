| <img src="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/planet/images/gstgotchi.png" class="favicon"> **gstreamer**  | [(C)](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer) [(M)](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/lists/) [(I)](irc://irc.freenode.org/#gstreamer) | GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface. | Used by **gst-switch**, **speakertrack** and **flumotion**. |
| **eventstreamer**  | [(C)](https://github.com/lukejohnosmahi/eventstreamr) | EventStreamer is a single and multi room audio visual stream management. It is designed to scale down for a single monthly LUG talk and scale up for conferences such as linux.conf.au. The base OS image forms the foundation for eventstreamr. The goals are simple: every host has the base image installed, the base image includes all software required to perform all roles and simple setup script to go from imaged to production. | Used by **linux.conf.au 2014** and **[PLUG](http://plug.org.au)**. |
