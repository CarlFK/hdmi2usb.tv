> Firstly, I’d like to say thank you for your all your support so far! It’s
> awesome to see that we have reached over 60% of our goal after only being up
> for a week.
> 
> A number of people who are unable to purchase a board have asked how they can
> support the project so we put together the following list:
> 
>  * We now have a “Support Us!” pledge level on the crowdfunding page which
>    allows you to donate money towards getting the board into production.
> 
>  * The crowdfunding campaign is extremely dependent on people knowing about it!
>    Please share the crowdfunding campaign page on Twitter, Facebook, Google+
>    and anywhere else that is appropriate.
> 
>  * Help out with development! We have a wide variety of things which need to be
>    done from coding tasks, system administration, web design, helping with
>    documentation and much more. Most tasks don’t require you to have any
>    hardware and many don’t require any coding!
> 
>  * Join our mailing lists and IRC channel and continue to be excited about the
>    project. Seeing all the people that are excited makes us excited to do even
>    more cool things.
> 
> Cheers,
> Timvideos & Numato Lab
