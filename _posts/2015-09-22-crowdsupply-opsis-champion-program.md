> Hello Backers!
> 
> With the campaign already over 120%, we know that some of you are super
> impatient to get your hands on an Opsis board and might be happy to live on
> the bleeding edge. We have a limited number of “pre-production” boards left
> over from the prototyping run and rather than having them sit around
> collecting dust, would like to send them to people who will do cool things
> with them! Hence we are happy to announce the “Numato Opsis Champion”
> program.
>
> [Order a Numato Opsis board at CrowdSupply.com](https://www.crowdsupply.com/numato-lab/opsis),
> then tell us about your project and why you can’t wait by filling out this
> [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/a/crowdsupply.com/forms/d/1gt6ZKw6CgtVWSvxZXw4ge9V1E58OUiKtlQLrKHmdLWk/viewform)
> before Friday, 2nd October ends 
> [AoE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth). The form has only 3
> short questions for you to fill out! For the best entries, we will ship a
> pre-production board for free. As these boards are already manufactured, they
> will ship well before the campaign ends! Winners will of course also receive
> their ordered production board like every other backer.
>
> We don’t have any set criteria for evaluating the entries but are looking for
> people who are going to do something awesome or something which helps the
> community. Anything from helping write sample code, porting existing projects
> to the board, using the board for event capture or in some type of artwork or
> performance, to even just plugging the board into everything you can find are
> all potential winners. We are sure we haven’t even imagined some of the cool
> things you will come up with.
>
> As you will be receiving a pre-production Opsis, well before our planned
> shipping date, you need to be prepared to deal with things like incomplete
> documentation, missing or incomplete tooling and sample code, things which
> just plain don’t work. Please understand the ride will be bumpier than what
> people will get when receiving the production boards. These prototyping
> boards are functional but did require some small manual fix ups to work
> correctly (which have already been done by us) and are a bit rougher than the
> final boards.
>
> Look forward to hearing about all the cool things you want to do!
>
> Cheers, TimVideos & Numato Lab
