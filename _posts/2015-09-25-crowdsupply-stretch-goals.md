<i>This item is cross posted from the CrowdSupply.com crowdfunding campaign.</i>
</a>

> Hello Backers!
> 
> With the campaign already at 144% and still a little under 5 weeks left, we
> have been trying to come up with good ideas on how to keep the momentum
> going. We want to get the Opsis board into the hands of as many people as
> possible because it increases the number of cool things that happen. While we
> are certain that you all will continue to spread the word, we thought that
> some extra incentives couldn’t hurt!
> 
> With that in mind, I’m happy to announce that with every 25 boards that are
> ordered as part of the campaign, a stretch goal will be completed, unlocking
> new purchase options or getting more stuff included with your Numato Opsis
> board.
> 
> ### Goal 1 @ 25 boards - Crowdfunding campaign is successful and people get Numato Opsis boards
> Already completed, you all rock!
> 
> ----
> 
> ### Goal 2 - 50 boards - Unlock the “Low speed I/O” TOFE board for purchase
> 
> While the Numato Opsis board has a massive amount of high speed I/O
> interfaces, it doesn’t include many features for interfacing with more
> pedestrian speed devices such as buttons or LEDs. To help solve this problem,
> we are currently designing the “Low speed I/O” TOFE board. While the board
> has yet to be finalized, the following features will probably be included;
> 
>  * An Arduino compatible pin header, allowing interfacing with most existing
>    Arduino expansion boards.
>  * Multiple PMOD headers, allowing interfacing with many existing boards from
>    a wide range of manufactures, including Numato.
>  * A number of indicator LEDs.
>  * A number of push button and toggle switches.
>  * When more than 50 boards are ordered from the campaign, we’ll open up the
>    purchase of this board for $25USD.
>

> ### Goal 3 - 75 boards - Unlock the “Milkymist Compatibility” TOFE board for purchase
> 
> The Numato Opsis is already very similar to the Milkymist and Mixxeo devices
> created by M-Labs. It is however missing a couple of features those boards
> have. This TOFE board is designed to cover those remaining missing features
> and will include;
> 
> * AC-97 compatible audio interface.
> * Two DMX512 (RS485) ports
> * MIDI IN and MIDI OUT ports
> * Infrared receiver and sender
> * RS232 compatible serial port
> * A number of push buttons
> 
> When more than 75 boards are ordered from the campaign, we’ll open up the purchase of this board for $35USD.

>
> ### Goal 4 - 100 boards - Everyone gets a “Low speed I/O” TOFE board with their Numato Opsis board!
> 
> If more than 100 boards are ordered from the campaign, we will have hit a
> large enough economy of scale that we can include one of the “Low speed I/O”
> TOFE board with every Numato Opsis board order.
> 
> People will be able to add either one of the boards to their existing
> purchase for free. People who had already ordered the TOFE board will have
> the option of being refunded their money.
> 
> ----
>
> I hope that gets everyone even more excited about the Numato Opsis board and
> what you can do with them. We really want to do all these things, so it is up
> to you to get the word out! The campaign page will be updated shortly.
