> Hi everyone,
> 
> We have gotten a lot of questions about the video capabilities of 
> [the Opsis board](https://www.crowdsupply.com/numato-lab/opsis)
> which is understandable because it took us ~3 years to understand the space!
> To help clarify things we have
> [added a new FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1noNqTdLYlEru_6gWOlFqFvYe-vctUE23Tp42oRoKKKo/pub) 
> dealing exclusively with the details around HDMI, DisplayPort and the
> revisions, resolutions and formats that the Opsis board supports.
> 
> The important summary of the information is that on the Opsis;
>
> * The HDMI connectors support resolutions with equivalent bandwidth of SXGA @
>   60Hz (1280×1024 @ 60Hz progressive) which includes;
>   - XGA@85Hz (1024×768 @ 85Hz progressive),
>   - 1080p30 (1920×1080 @ 30Hz progressive),
>   - 1080i60 (1920×1080 @ 60Hz interlaced),
>   - 720p60 (1280×720 @ 60Hz progressive),
>   - but **not** 1080p60 (1920×1080 @ 60Hz progressive).
>
> * The DisplayPort connector supports resolutions up to a bandwidth of
>   ~12Gbit/s which include extremely high resolutions like 4096 × 2160 @ 24Hz.
> 
> * The DisplayPort connector is dual-mode enabled and thus **can operate as high
>   speed HDMI ports** using cheap adapters. When operating in HDMI modes, many
>   high resolutions up to 3840 x 2160 @ 30Hz should work.
> 
> If you any feedback on the information, please comment on the 
> [Google Docs version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1noNqTdLYlEru_6gWOlFqFvYe-vctUE23Tp42oRoKKKo/edit)
> and we will try and get it incorporated into the CrowdSupply page.
