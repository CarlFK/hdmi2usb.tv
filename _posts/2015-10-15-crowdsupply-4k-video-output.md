> Mike has been hard at work 
> [implementing a fully open source DisplayPort core](https://github.com/hamsternz/FPGA_DisplayPort),
> so we were keen to get him an Numato Opsis board (we shipped him the third
> board ever made). Currently his implementation is only using 2 of the 4 high
> speed transceiver lanes on the Opsis but he is working on getting the other
> two lanes working to effectively double the bandwidth and enabling full
> 3840×2160p60 (although Mike’s monitor doesn’t go that high, guess he needs a
> new one :-). It has been awesome to be working with Mike and getting the
> Opsis fully supported with his work.
> 
> Over the next couple of weeks we should have some cool demos (plus less
> blurry videos / screenshots!) and code samples which show how to make use of
> this type of functionality as it can be tricky.
