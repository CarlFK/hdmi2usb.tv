> Hello backers!
>
> Well you guys have done it, we have reached our first stretch goal and are
> proud to announce the availability of the “Low Speed I/O” TOFE board! Just to
> refresh your memory, here is what we said in our stretch goal update:
> 
> > “While the Numato Opsis board has a massive amount of high speed I/O
> > interfaces, it doesn’t include many features for interfacing with more
> > pedestrian speed devices such as buttons or LEDs. To help solve this
> > problem, we are currently designing the “Low speed I/O” TOFE board.”
>
> The board can be [added to your order](https://www.crowdsupply.com/numato-lab/opsis/updates/1834)
> at a discounted price of $20 USD until the campaign ends (when it will be
> available for $25 USD).
> 
> The “Low Speed I/O” board has the following confirmed features:
> 
> * 1 x Arduino compatible pin header. The board includes an ADC meaning that even the analog pins should work.
> * 4 x Digilent Pmod™ Compatible headers[1] to allow usage of existing expansion boards, including boards from Numato Lab, Digilent, Maxim and Analog.
> * 6 x Indicator LEDs
> * 4 x Push Buttons
> * 1 x USB UART

> As this board adds Arduino shield compatibility, we are currently investigating
> [ZPUino](http://zpuino.blogspot.com/) [(PDF user manual)](http://www.alvie.com/zpuino/downloads/zpuino-1.0.pdf)
> to allow reusing existing Arduino code.
> 
> The full schematic and PCB design can be found in the
> [timvideos/HDMI2USB-TOFE-LowSpeedIO repository](https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB-TOFE-LowSpeedIO).
> We are also in the process of releasing a KiCad template for creating TOFE
> expansion boards which will be found in the
> [timvideos/HDMI2USB-TOFE-kicad-template repository](https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB-TOFE-kicad-template) - we already
> have people interested in working on both 
> [SDI video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_digital_interface) and 
> [VGA expansion boards](https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB-vmodvga).

> Cheers,

> *[1]: Two of the Pmod headers share pins with the Arduino header. This means that when the Arduino compatible pin header is in use only 2 Pmod headers are available.*
