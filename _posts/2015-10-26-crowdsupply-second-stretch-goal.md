> Hello backers!
> 
> Thank you everyone, at around 26 hours left in the campaign, we reached our
> second stretch goal! You can now add the “Milkymist Compatibility” TOFE board
> to your order at special introductory price of $35 USD. Because the campaign
> is almost over, this price will be available after the campaign as a
> “pre-order”, but only until 6pm Friday PDT (10/30). We have worked hard to
> provide the board at our target price to Crowd Supply backers but the feature
> set means it will be available at $50 USD after 10/30, get yours now!
> 
> We are excited to enable interfacing with a wide range of controllers which
> support DMX or MIDI. The audio support on the TOFE board should also provide
> a lot of cool new possibilities that we haven’t previously thought about. The
