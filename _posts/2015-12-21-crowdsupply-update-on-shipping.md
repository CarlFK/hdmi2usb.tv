> Hello Backers,
> 
> Firstly, I want to apologize for the radio silence since the campaign was
> successfully funded â€“ we have been super busy getting production up and
> running and developing the tools needed to make using your Opsis and the new
> expansion boards a great experience!
> 
> On that note, we are planning on starting to ship the Opsis boards very soon.
> We have had a couple of setbacks in the production process but are working
> hard so that the majority of you still receive your boards before your
> delivery date. The updated delivery schedule is as follows;
> 
> * For the first 25 backers (with delivery marked as November or December), we
>   will be delivering the devices to Crowd Supply on the second week of January.
> * For all the remaining backers and pre-orders (with delivery marked as
>   January, February, March or April), we will be delivering the devices to
>   Crowd Supply at the end of January / early February.
> 
> After the devices are received by Crowd Supply, they will endeavor to get
> them shipped to backers ASAP. (For backers in India, the boards will be
> shipped directly from Numato rather than through Crowd Supply.)
> 
> There has also been some confusion delivery dates of the TOFE expansion
> boards. Both types of expansion boards will ship **with** your Opsis board(s)
> as one package.
> 
> This also means that if you put in a pre-order before the end of December, we
> will try and get it included in the second group so you should receive your
> boards before the end of February!
> 
> After boards are received by Crowd Supply, their crew will then shipped the
> individual boards to backers. **It is important that your shipping address is
> correct *before* Crowd Supply start this process. Please check this now and
> contact support to have it corrected if wrong.**
> 
> Wishing everyone a happy holidays!
