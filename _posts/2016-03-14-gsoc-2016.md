The [TimVideos.us project](https://code.timvideos.us) is happy to announce that
it has been selected to participate in the [Google Summer of Code for 2016
(GSoC)](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/). GSoC is a program
where students are paid to contribute to selected open source projects over the
northern hemisphere summer, [flip bits not
burgers](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/flip-bits-not-burgers-google-summer-of.html)!


[The application period is now
open](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and [students
have until 25 March 19:00 UTC to apply to work with the TimVideos.us
project](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/). The [list of proposal
ideas](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues) includes
contributing to the [HDMI2USB](https://hdmi2usb.tv) and things related to the
[Numato Opsis](https://www.crowdsupply.com/numato-lab/opsis). Due to the focus
on hardware, we are very interested in students who are interested in things
like [VHDL/Verilog and other
HDLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language), embedded C
programming and operating systems and [electronic circuit/PCB
design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_design). Some possible ideas
include;

 * [Working on USB 3.0 support for ultra high speed video
   capture.](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues/5)

 * Porting a real operating system 
   [such as Linux](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues/30) or RTEMS to
   [our SoC](https://m-labs.hk/gateware.html) to [allow easier development of
   new features](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues/33).

 * Making use of the [Ethernet interface for connecting multiple devices
   together](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues/32) and
   alternative capture interfaces.

 * [Creating new expansion board and supporting the professional SDI
   standard](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues/2).

 * [and many, many more](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues).

If you are interested in applying, your first point of call should be [our
Google Summer of Code page](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/). Even if
you can't apply to GSoC, you can also help us by forwarding this message to
anyone you might think who is interested!
