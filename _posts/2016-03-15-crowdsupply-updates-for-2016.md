> Hello everyone,
> 
> Firstly, I would like to apologize for the lack of communication over the
> last couple of months. The start of 2016 has been extremely busy for both
> [the TimVideos.us](https://code.timvideos.us) and [Numato
> teams](/http://numato.com/). This update will give you an insight into what
> we have been up to; shipping Opsis boards, planning for 2016, recording
> Linux.conf.au, getting into Google’s Summer of Code for 2016, and an update
> on some compatibility issues we’ve working on.
>
> ### Shipping
> By now, everyone who participated in the crowdfunding campaign should have
> received notification of shipment, if not your board. Pre-orders will go out
> soon - you will receive a shipping confirmation email with a tracking number
> once your order ships).  You can see some cool pictures from the first
> shipment which arrived at Crowd Supply below.

> ### Planning for 2016
>
> With the start of a new year, the TimVideos project posted a
> [project roadmap for
> 2016](https://hdmi2usb.tv/timvideos/hdmi2usb/2016/01/11/new-year-roadmap/).
> It includes details on our achievements in 2015 and our major goals for 2016.
> As an Opsis board owner, you may find it interesting to see how we
> plan to use them and what we want to do in the future.

> ### Linux.conf.au Conference
> 
> In February, the TimVideos team also use the Numato Opsis boards for the
> first time to record a FOSS conference! The
> [Linux.conf.au](http://linux.conf.au) conference was recorded completely
> using the HDMI2USB firmware on a mixture of supported hardware (which
> includes the Numato Opsis boards). Recording the conference had some unique
> challenges such as 
> [universities projectors deciding to take a bath](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-28/weather-flood-hit-geelong-clean-up-will-cost-millions-mayor/7119466)!
> You can find the
> [LCA videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/linuxconfau2016),
> or on the 
> [Linux Australia FTP mirror](http://mirror.linux.org.au/linux.conf.au/2016/).

> ### Google Summer of Code
>
> The [TimVideos.us project is also happy to announce](https://hdmi2usb.tv/gsoc/hdmi2usb/2016/03/14/gsoc-2016/)
> that it has been selected to participate in the
> [Google Summer of Code for 2016 (GSoC)](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/).
> GSoC is a program where students are paid to contribute to selected open
> source projects over the northern hemisphere summer, 
> [flip bits not burgers](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/flip-bits-not-burgers-google-summer-of.html)!
> [The application period is now open](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline)
> and [students have until 25 March 19:00 UTC to apply to work with the TimVideos.us
> project](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/). 
> The [list of proposal ideas](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues)
> includes contributing to the [HDMI2USB](https://hdmi2usb.tv) and things
> related to the [Numato Opsis](https://www.crowdsupply.com/numato-lab/opsis).

> ### Compatibility Update
> 
> During recording LCA, we did discover a compatibility between the Opsis board
> and some devices. We are currently investigating the root cause of these
> issues and believe it should be resolvable with a firmware update. As a
> temporary workaround, you can use HDMI cables which include inbuilt
> amplifiers ([such as these with Redmere technology from
> Monoprice](http://www.monoprice.com/category?c_id=102&cp_id=10255)) on the
> inputs. A further backer update will be released within 30 days with more
> information.
> 
> Thanks everyone for your support in making the Opsis a reality and reaching
> this milestone!
