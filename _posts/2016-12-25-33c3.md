This is a quick post to mention that [Mithro](https://blog.mithis.net/) will be
speaking at the
[33rd Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Static:Main_Page)
on
[Dissecting HDMI](https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2016/Fahrplan/events/8057.html).
The talk is based on the HDMI2USB development and will include tales from using
the HDMI2USB firmware to capture conferences!

If you are attending the conference, you can catch it live in 
[Saal 1](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Room:Saal_1) on the 
[29th December at 17:15 (5:15pm)](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/to?msg=Dissecting%20HDMI%20%28Mithro%27s%20talk%20at%2033C3%29&p0=307&year=2016&month=12&day=29&hour=17&min=15&sec=0&fromtheme=generic).
The talk will be [live streamed](https://streaming.media.ccc.de/)
[thanks to the C3VOC](https://c3voc.de/) and post conference a recording should
be available a [media.ccc.de/c/33c3](https://media.ccc.de/c/33c3).

He gave a sneak preview of the talk to a small group of [lucky hackers at
Metalab.at in Vienna, Austria](https://metalab.at/wiki/Tim_Ansell). A big thank
you to both [Metalab.at](https://metalab.at) and the [Apertus
Project](https://www.apertus.org) for giving Mithro the chance to practice.

Talk abstract is included below;

>
> ### Developing open, FPGA-based capture hardware for conference & user group recording
> 
> Ever wondered what is actually happening when a speaker can't get their laptop
> to project? While developing the FPGA-based [HDMI2USB.tv open hardware for
> recording conferences](https://hdmi2usb.tv), we discovered just how
> convoluted the HDMI protocol can be. Come hear all the horrible details!
> 
> The [TimVideos.us group aims](https://code.timvideos.us) to make it easy for
> anyone to create high quality recordings of conferences and user groups. To
> achieve this goal we have developed the HDMI2USB.tv project, an FPGA based,
> fully open (hardware and firmware) solution for capturing HDMI video signals.
> The solution has been in use since late 2015 and used at numerous conferences
> such as [Linux.conf.au](http://linux.conf.au), [DebConf](https://debconf.org)
> and many [PyCon conferences](https://pycon.org) around the world.
> 
> To be truly FOSS has however meant developing code for doing HDMI receiving and
> sending. Come hear about all the issues we have run into and the nitty gritty
> details about how it works (or doesn't!). By the end of the talk you will know
> more than you ever wanted to about the HDMI protocol!
> 
> This talk will cover:
> 
>  * The HDMI video standard, including
>    - An overview of the many protocols and standards required.
>    - A high level description of the low speed protocols needed such as DCD
>      (EDID) and CEC.
>    - An in-depth dive into the high speed TMDS protocol and encoding.
>  * How to build a HDMI receiver and transmission to run on an FPGA.
>  * War stories from trying to use the HDMI2USB capture device for recording
>    FOSS conference, including;
>    - Why your HDMI cable can actually matter.
>    - Some of the reasons why plugging in a screen doesn't always "just work".
>    - Doing error correction on a protocol which doesn't have any.
