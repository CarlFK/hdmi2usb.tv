        <h4 class="post-date">Jul 1, 2015</h4>
        <p><p>The <a href="http://code.timvideos.us/">TimVideos project</a> and <a href="http://numato.com/">Numato
Lab</a> are pleased to announce the Numato &#8220;Opsis&#8221; open video
platform. The Opsis platform is an exciting new FPGA based open hardware,
specifically designed for the needs of the HDMI2USB project.</p>

<p>With dual inputs and dual outputs, which can all be controlled independently,
the board removes the need for extra matrix switching hardware, reducing
complexity of recording set up.</p>

<p>The HDMI2USB firmware is also designed to provide a large amount debugging
information which is all programmatically available by a virtual serial port.
The Opsis board enables even further support by including full control over all
pins, including hot plug, enabling &#8220;virtual disconnection&#8221; without having to
unplug and re-plug cables.</p>

<p>The TimVideos project is already experimenting with the new functionality
available through the Opsis board and is currently investigating new features
like streaming video directly via Gigabit Ethernet or capturing live to a local
SD card.</p>

<p>The Opsis board has also been targeted at people interested and involved with
video creation, manipulation and research. The Opsis board&#8217;s features enables a
wide range of video related applications and is designed not only for
development but to become the core of your intelligent digital video system.
Potential integration applications include everything from a simple &#8220;smart&#8221;
video matrix to live video manipulation in visual art installations. </p>

<p>Overall, the new <a href="">Opsis board</a> has the following differences with the 
<a href="">Atlys board</a> used for prototyping.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Has DDR3 memory instead of DDR2, increasing the memory bandwidth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has a Spartan S6LX45T with the GTP broken out to DisplayPort headers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has a PCI-Express style expansion connector instead of the expensive VHDCI
connector, allow much cheaper expansion boards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has all the extra pins on the FX2, increasing the potential USB interface
options.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Has control over all the HDMI functionality, including hot plug and CEC
functionality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Removes parts we donâ€™t need such as the audio, buttons, switches and LEDs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mounts in any ITX style computer case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adds UTMI USB (as well as the Cypress FX2).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adds MicroSD connector.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Carl enjoying a drink after a long flight</p>
</div>

<p>When he boarded the plane in San Francisco, Google Summer of Code mentor Carl
knew he was going to miss one of the world&#8217;s most well-documented annual
events. It was New Year&#8217;s Eve and thanks to the international dateline, Carl
would arrive in Auckland, New Zealand (aka Middle Earth) on the morning of
January 2. While he was sacrificing his chance to capture the fireworks, the
work that Carl and a team of GSoC mentors and students were converging to
tackle would empower others to record something more enduring than those sky
sparkles.</p>

<p>When he arrived in the &#8220;land of the long white cloud&#8221; Carl met with
<a href="http://dreamsxtrinsic.blogspot.com.au/">Rohit</a> and
<a href="http://ajitmathewgsoc.blogspot.com.au/">Ajit</a>, two GSoC 2014 students who had
travelled even further but in the opposite direction, leaving from India. Rohit
was venturing overseas for the first time.  In the following days, the group
was joined by GSoC 2015 student <a href="http://hyades.github.io">Aayush</a>, also from
India, and GSoC mentor <a href="http://blog.mithis.net">Tim</a>, from Australia.</p>

<div class="image image-left">

</div>

<p>The GSoC participants and many others involved in the
<a href="http://code.timvideos.us/">TimVideos.us</a> project were converging for a
week-long coding sprint ahead of the <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">Linux.conf.au</a> conference, where they would
put their work to the test with video capture and streaming.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.timvideos.us/">TimVideos.us</a> is a group of projects that create a
system for doing both recording and live streaming for presentations at events
such as conferences, meetups, and user groups. The projects include both open
source software and open source hardware development. The aim is to reduce the
costs and expertise required to produce live streaming events to near zero. One
of the major goals for the project over the past two years has been to replace
an old standard definition system based on end-of-life hardware with a new,
high definition, completely FOSS solution.</p>

<p>Thanks to the massive effort of GSoC students in 2013 and 2014, and with help
from many other volunteers, the projects were getting close to serving their
intended purpose. The sprinters hoped to get the tools to the stage where they
could start experimenting with them during the conference. </p>

<p>GSoC students had been fundamental in getting the systems ready, so it made
sense to give GSoC students the opportunity to use their code and hardware in
the high-stress environment of a conference. There&#8217;s nothing like a trial by
fire.</p>

<p>The sprint was extremely productive, the group sent 54 pull requests and closed
27 issues. The sprints focused on two of the TimVideos projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://github.com/timvideos/gst-switch">gst-switch</a>, a software video mixer
based around gstreamer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://hdmi2usb.tv">HDMI2USB</a>, open hardware and firmware for capturing
HDMI and DVI streams from a projector. <a href="http://jms.id.au/">Joel</a>, Ajit&#8217;s
mentor in 2014, gave a talk about the HDMI2USB project.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After the sprints the conference began, and the real challenges with it. Given
the importance of ensuring video was actually captured, the team set up the
old, proven pipeline.</p>

<p><a href="http://linux.conf.au">Linux.conf.au</a> is the biggest FOSS conference in the
Oceania region and attracts people from around the world, including luminaries
such as Linus Torvalds. The conference is in a different city each year,
generally in Australia but occasionally in New Zealand as in 2015. While
travelling from Australia to New Zealand is relatively easy for Australians,
the extra cost of a passport can mean some aren&#8217;t able to attend, so live
streaming was provided to allow those people to view the proceedings.</p>

<p>Many of the conference talks are important to the FOSS community globally, so
the presentations are all recorded and shared freely under a CC-BY-SA license.
Reliable, high quality recordings are important to facilitate this sharing.
They are all freely available on the 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/linuxconfau2015">Linux.conf.au 2015 YouTube channel</a>
or via the 
<a href="http://mirror.linux.org.au/linux.conf.au/2015">Linux.org.au mirror</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>A number of organisations came together to facilitate this work. There was
funding from Linux.conf.au, Google Conference grants for the GSoC students, a
venue provided by Catalyst IT and a donation from Tim. These folks deserve a
huge thank you for making such awesomeness possible.</p>
